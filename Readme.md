# NAV TechDays 2019: {ConnectApp}Â² Main Demo

This repository contains the React Native app that was presented by 
[@vjekob](https://twitter.com/vjekob/) and [@waldo1001](https://twitter.com/waldo1001/)
delivered on November 22.

The app had a different name during the presentation, but this public
repo uses the more generic "NAV TechDays 2019: Main Demo" instead, to
avoid any potential copyright infringement with the app as presented.
